  Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn — the likelihood of a customer discontinuing a service — using logistic regression. By analyzing historical customer data (such as usage behavior, service plans, and support interactions), we built a predictive model that helps identify at-risk customers so businesses can take proactive retention actions.

 Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy for data handling and preprocessing
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for data visualization
Scikit-learn for building and evaluating a Logistic Regression model

 Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns, handled missing and inconsistent values.
EDA: Explored churn patterns across gender, tenure, contract type, etc.
Preprocessing: Encoded categorical variables and scaled features.
Modeling: Trained a logistic regression classifier to predict churn.
Evaluation: Used accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model performance.

 Outcome:
Achieved a solid baseline model that identifies customers at risk of leaving, enabling targeted interventions to reduce churn.
